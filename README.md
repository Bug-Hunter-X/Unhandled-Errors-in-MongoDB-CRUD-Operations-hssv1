# MongoDB CRUD Operations with Improved Error Handling

This repository demonstrates common MongoDB operations and highlights the importance of robust error handling to prevent unexpected failures and data corruption.

The initial `bug.js` file shows a basic implementation of CRUD operations without comprehensive error handling. The `bugSolution.js` file offers an improved version with more robust error handling and better practices.

## Issues in `bug.js`

- **Missing Error Handling:**  The original code lacks proper error handling.  Network issues, database connection problems, or invalid queries can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. 
- **Improper Resource Management:** The `client.close()` call might not always execute if an error occurs before reaching it. This can lead to connection leaks. 

## Solution in `bugSolution.js`

- **`try...catch...finally` blocks:** The improved version uses try-catch-finally blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
- **Detailed Error Logging:**  It logs more comprehensive error details to aid in debugging. 
- **Ensured Resource Closure:** `client.close()` is called in a `finally` block, ensuring the connection is closed even if errors arise. 
- **Explicit Checks:** It includes checks to ensure that operations were successful before proceeding.

This example underscores the importance of meticulously handling errors when interacting with databases.
